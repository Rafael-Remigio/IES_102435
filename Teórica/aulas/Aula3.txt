	agile is not a methodology
	
	agile is a Guidance and methods on how to procede better
	
	agile are principles not a methodology
	

	iterative approach -> like many litle watterfalls
		in each of those cycles we should have a working prototype

	
	
	a methodology of agile -> Extreme programming
	
		most widely used approach to agile software decelopment
		no one follows it 100%, should adapt it to our needs

		during the same day we should make many commits and have very different versions of the software

		first we develop the test for the system and only then do we develop the system
			this forces us to think about what can be the problems that can occur in a system
			some companies have testing and developing teams

		Continuous integration -> i write line, i compile,i test, i deploy
	
		Sustainablepace -> time managment is very important, things should be well planed and there can be almost no delays
		 

		On-sitecustomer -> dialogue with costumer
